Before using PhoenixSuit, you need to install the driver at the same time: [Allwinner USB Driver](https://www.aw-ol.com/downloads/resources/15)

> Enterprise developers will also install the Allwinner USB driver when installing APST, so there is no need to install it separately

Specific steps are as follows:

1. Open PhoenixSuit, when the device is powered on and connected to the PC, PhoenixSuit will prompt to recognize the device;
2. Click `One-click flash-browse` to select the firmware to be flashed;
3. Click `Upgrade now`, then a restart command will be sent to the device through USB, the device will restart with the programming logo, and enter the flash mode in the restart stage;
4.  When the device returns to boot, it will be automatically programmed, and you can see that the progress bar of PhoenixSuit is moving;
5. After the flash is successful, the device restarts.

If the software cannot automatically connect to the development board, please follow the steps below to force to the download mode:

1. Power on the development board, press and hold the FEL button on the board
2. Click the RST button
3. After the PC is connected to the development board, release the FEL button
4. Just wait for the download
